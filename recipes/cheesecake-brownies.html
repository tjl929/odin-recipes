      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
      <li>Combine cream cheese with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 egg in a mixing bowl; beat until smooth.</li>
      <li>Stir 1 cup chocolate chips into the cream cheese mixture. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Fill a saucepan with water and bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Turn the heat off, and set a heatproof mixing bowl over the water.</li>
      <li>In the mixing bowl, combine butter with the remaining cup of chocolate chips; stir until just melted and blended together.</li>
      <li>Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and 2 eggs, then sift together flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into chocolate until evenly blended.</li>
      <li>Pour half of the batter into the prepared baking pan.</li>
      <li>Spread the cream cheese mixture over the chocolate layer.</li>
      <li>Top with remaining chocolate mixture (this doesn't need to completely cover the cream cheese layer).</li>
      <li>Using a knife, swirl the top chocolate layer into the cream cheese to make a marble pattern.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until top is crinkled and edges pull away from sides of the pan. Cool thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Cut into 12 to 16 squares. Store in the refrigerator or freeze.</li>
